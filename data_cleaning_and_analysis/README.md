# Data cleaning and analysis
Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

In this project, I showcase skills in data manipulation and analysis using the carbon emission dataset available on Kaggle. Following data collection, I perform comprehensive treatment, including recommendations, standardization, and normalization of country codes, among other tasks. Subsequently, I present correlations and trends over the years through animated geographical charts.
