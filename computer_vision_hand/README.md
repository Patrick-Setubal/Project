# Computer vision hand
Python (OpenCV, MediaPipe, Pynput, Numpy)

    I developed a Python application that enables interaction with the computer exclusively through hand movements, allowing functions such as drawing and writing on a virtual keyboard. This project reinforces the creative and innovative potential of computer vision in the context of contactless interaction.
