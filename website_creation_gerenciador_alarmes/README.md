# Website Creation Alarm Manager
Python (Flask, Pandas, Fpdf...) 
HTML,CSS,JS (Tabulador, Jquerry, Chart, Dropzone...)


I developed a project that encompasses both the visual aspect of the website and its backend. The main focus was on creating an alarm manager, consolidating all essential information in a single location. The platform features variable graphs, filters, SAP order statuses, notifications, alarms, and more. Additionally, I used the same framework to build an additional application called "Cockpit," providing a detailed monitoring space for processes and orders. This application also generates personalized PDF reports to streamline the information delivery to clients.
